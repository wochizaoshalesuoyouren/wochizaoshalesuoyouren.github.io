	<h3>Analysis: </h3> <p>其实总体来看还算是蛮有趣的，文本不错，没有语法和用词的错误，使用的时候也让人乐在其中。	</p>
  <p>In fact, it is quite interesting on the whole. The text is good, and there are no grammatical and lexical errors. It is also enjoyable when used.</p>
	<h3>My idea:</h3>
  <p>但要论问题的话还是不少。从我自己的角度来看，它能够生成出的东西太过于局限了，唯一能够改变设定的是两个人物名字，多生成几次就会发现生成出来的来来回回就那么几个文章模版。因为这些原因，我认为这种生成文章工具在目前阶段并不足够完整，并且用处不大。优点是言语和文章结构都没有问题，生成出来的文章我挺喜欢的（这种题材）。</p>
	
  <p> But there is still a lot to talk about. From my own point of view, what it can generate is too limited. The only thing that can change the setting is two character names. If you generate more times, you will find that the generated back and forth are just a few article templates. For these reasons, I think this article generation tool is not complete enough at the current stage and is not useful.The advantage is that there are no problems with the language or structure of the article, and I quite like the generated article.</p>
