<p> OMORI is a role-playing game. The story is based on the online comic series &quot;omori ひ き こ り&quot; by the game director OMOCAT. It tells the story of a boy and the dream personality Omori exploring the dream and the real world together. Four people fight with the imaginary enemy in turn. The shape effect depends on the character's mood. The game has two routes, and there are many endings according to the player's choice. </p>
<p>These are official statements. And what I want to say is: this is</p>
<p>THE&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first, I was attracted by its painting style and theme, and I began to play this game. </p>
<p>After playing, I first had nightmares for several days,</p>
<p>&nbsp;which reminded me of the "NIGHTMARE " in the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p> <img src="../Pictures/Saved Pictures/微信图片_20230305210836.jpg" width="1594" height="1034" alt=""> It makes me have many thoughts in my mind and many complex emotions in my heart. It sounds like this game has had a lot of bad effects on me, right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;But after that, I felt all the HOPE and BEAUTY bred. OMORI brings me peace after severe pain. I feel HAPPY and benefited. </p>
<p> <img src="../Pictures/Saved Pictures/微信图片_20230305201244.jpg" width="2200" height="1280" alt=""> It can even CURE me and MAKE me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I deeply experienced the magic of OMORI. I smiled with tears.</p>
